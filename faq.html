	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<h2>Will anyone see my entries?</h2>
	  <p>The way the website is formatted allows your entries to be immediately terminated. This feature won't allow anyone to peek into your entries!</p>
    <br></br>
	<h2>How does this website work?</h2>
	  <p>You click on one of the flowers that have an emotion and the flower will lead you to another page that allows you to put whatever you want on the prompt. Maybe you want to write down your emotions and vent. The choice is all yours!</p>
    <br></br>	
	<h2>What if I want to save my prompt for another time?</h2>
	  <p>We are sorry to say that we currently do not provide that kind of service. However, in the near future we may possibly impliment a feature like it.</p>
    <br></br>
	<h2>Who is behind <i> FloraLife </i>?</h2>
	  <p>Our website's team consists of three people: Kallista, Eman, and Lea. </p>
